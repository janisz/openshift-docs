If you are using custom priorities or mandatory custom fields in your Jira project, you may get an error when you try to integrate {product-title} with Jira Software.
This error might be because of the mismatch between the severity and the priority field values.

If you do not know the custom priority values in your JIRA project, use the `roxctl` CLI to enable debug logging for JIRA integration.

.Procedure
. To get the custom priority values from your JIRA project, run the following command to turn on debug logging for JIRA integration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central debug log --level Debug --modules pkg/notifiers/jira
----
. Follow the instructions to configure {product-title} for Jira integration. When you test the integration, even if the integration test fails, the generated log includes your JIRA project schema and the custom priorities.
. To save the debugging information as a compressed `.zip` file, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central debug dump
----
. Unzip the `.zip` file to retrieve the custom priority values in use in your JIRA project.
. To turn off debug logging, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS" central debug log --level Info
----
. Configure {product-title} for Jira integration again and use the priority values to configure custom priorities.
